# CivNexus6

CivNexus6 is a tool for importing/exporting .fgx files for making custom Civilization 6 graphics. 

To use it you will need to have the Windows registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Firaxis\Tools - ToolAssetPath value set to any directory that contains two directories named "Assets" and "Resource". This dummy directory can be created anywhere.
